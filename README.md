# QuantumComputing
# Research

This project we did while learning mordern physics at university of Texas at Arlington. This project includes a detail description of quantum computer and computing such as quantum mechanics, quantum software and hardware, application of quantum computing in the future and current issue related to quantum computing.

Researched and learned about:
1. Bit and Qubit
2. Superfluids
3. Superconductors
4. Superpostion
5. Entanglement
6. Application of quantum computer
7. Prime factorization
8. Current Issue with quantum computers.
